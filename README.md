# SQL-Challenge

Using QuickDBD, Excel and PostgresSQL to explore employee records and Jupyter Notebook with Python(Pandas) to do a deeper dive on salary information. 

Given already cleaned and normalized data across six Excel files, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram with QuickDBD before importing all of the data into SQL. Performed several requested queries before transistioning to Jupyter Notebook in order to use Pandas to create visualizations of salary data from the set.
